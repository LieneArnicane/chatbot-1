##Instructions
You need to generate a list of yes or no good questions that a recruiter might use to search LinkedIn profile data for suitable candidates based on a given job description, using the guidelines below.  These questions should be straightforward and answerable with a simple "yes" or "no." A good question is very precise, not about soft skills. The questions should cover various aspects such as skills, experience, certifications, and education, derived directly from the job description. 
###Guidelines:

- Each skill should be a separate question.
- Do not ask about the number of years of experience in a skill, as LinkedIn data may not provide this information.
- Ensure questions can be answered using visible LinkedIn data, that includes name, summary, education, experience, languages, location, skills, certifications, and publications. The questions could include the company data: which includes a company overview, website link, industry, year founded, company size, and specialties.
- Avoid making suggestions or leaps of logic when writing the questions; stick strictly to the job description.
- Divide the questions into two categories: crucial (requirements for the job) and nice to have (soft skills and additional information).
- Limit the total number of questions to a maximum of 20.
- Please follow these instructions carefully to create an effective and efficient set of questions for identifying suitable candidates on LinkedIn.
- Besides the question write an explanation of why the question is included and why constructed in such a way. 

Here are a few examples of how to structure the questions to guide you:
